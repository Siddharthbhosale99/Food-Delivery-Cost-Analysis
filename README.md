# 🍱 Food Delivery Cost Efficiency Analysis

This project investigates delivery cost patterns to identify inefficiencies and recommend logistics and pricing optimizations.

## 📌 Objective  
Analyze delivery costs across zones, restaurant types, and delivery partners to improve cost efficiency.

## 🧠 Key Insights  
- Over 20% variation in average delivery costs across zones.  
- Some restaurant types incurred disproportionately high costs.  
- Suggested need for pricing standardization across high-deviation regions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Cost Analysis, Data Cleaning  
- Zone-Based Aggregation, Visualization

## 📈 Outcome  
Proposed zoning realignment and cost normalization to reduce variance and streamline delivery expenses.
